# Vaadin 8 extended maintenance version changelog

## Vaadin 8.19.0

* Changed license from Commercial Vaadin Developer License 4.0 to Vaadin Commercial License version 1. This change does not affect active subscribers, but it does mean that future releases of Vaadin Framework may move from dev- and build-time license checking to runtime license checking. Version 8.19.0 does not do that yet.
See LICENSE file in the downloadable package or [the Vaadin Commercial License and service terms document](https://vaadin.com/commercial-license-and-service-terms) for more information.
* Fixed issue [#12562](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/12562). The internal state of ComboBox got confused when adding new items after calling `clear()`.
* Improved the `vaadin-server-mpr-jakarta` and `vaadin-compatibility-server-mpr-jakarta` POM dependency definitions such that these packages do not pull in `vaadin-server` and `vaadin-compatibility-server` as unwanted dependencies, respectively.
* Fixed a number of assertion functions which would fail when MPR was in use. Improves testability of the framework and should allow running with assertions enabled in MPR configurations.
* Removed logging of Atmosphere version while MPR is in use. This fixes runtime failures under some configurations.
* Updated Atmosphere to version 2.4.30-vaadin5 in order to make Vaadin Framework 8 compatible with Jetty 10.
* Updated Vaadin License Checker to version 1.11.2 to support new license model.

## Vaadin 8.18.0

* Fixed issue [#12560](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/12560) by improving Grid's horizontal scrolling scrolling logic.
* Fixed an issue in Combobox where scrolling to selection would fail if the user had typed into the input field. Possibly related to [#12562](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/12562).
* Added `runAfterRoundTrip` API to the UI class for improved sequence control, allowing execution of a callback after one or more client-server round trips have been completed.
* Separated portlet support code out of `vaadin-server` into its own package, `vaadin-portlet`. **This will break your build** if your application makes use of Portlet classes and you do not import the `vaadin-portlet` dependency.
* Added support for Vaadin Multiplatform Runtime version 24+ by adding packages `vaadin-server-mpr-jakarta` and `vaadin-compatibility-server-mpr-jakarta`. This is only needed for MPR 24+, and is ***NOT*** guaranteed to work as generic Jakarta support (even though it does so at the moment) as we may add MPR specific functionality or even hard MPR dependencies in the future.

## Vaadin 8.17.0

* Improved hierarchical data container handling, resulting in increased speed and correcting some potential memory leaks.
* Fixed an issue in Grid's MultiSelect mode introduced by performance improvements made to Vaadin 8.16.0 which would erroneously cause a refreshed data item to become selected.
* Fixed an issue introduced in Vaadin 8.15.1's Grid focus stealing fix where the focus stealing prevention would become overly zealous.
* Updated JSoup version from 1.14.3 to 1.15.3. This is a **BREAKING CHANGE** for many projects, as it requires **you** to find all references to `org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist` and replace them with references to `org.jsoup.safety.Safelist`. The API of the two classes is the same; `Safelist` is a drop-in replacement for `Whitelist`. This change was made to all Vaadin versions simultaneously to address [CVE-2022-36033](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-36033) and keep the dependencies in line for use with [Vaadin MPR](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/tools/mpr/overview).
* Updated PuppyCrawl dependency from version 8.18 to 8.29
* Updated CheckStyle dependency from version 2.17 to 3.2.0

## Vaadin 8.16.1

* Fixed a failure-to-start condition on some server configurations (e.g. Tomcat) caused  by the connector map cleanup logic change in 8.16.0 
* Updated Jetty version from 9.4.43.v20210629 to 9.4.48.v20220622 to fix a potential security issue
* Updated License Checker version to support Vaadin 8 together with the latest Vaadin Flow in MPR configurations
* Updated the license information provided by vaadin-root POM to correctly show CVDL-4 as the project license instead of Apache-2.0 

## Vaadin 8.16.0

* Introduced Snippets feature for the RichTextArea component
* Moved connector map cleaning logic invocation from UI.unlock() to VaadinService.requestEnd() when not using Push
* Improved Grid multi-select performance
* Backported automatic conversion support and other Binder improvements from Vaadin Flow

## Vaadin 8.15.2

* Added support for Liferay kernel versions up to 49
* Changed all resources to use Object.class as interface type to support OSGi Portlets on Liferay CE 7.3.6 GA7 or later ([#12504](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/issues/12504))

## Vaadin 8.15.1

* Fixed an issue where Grid was moving focus away from external input controls when the datasource contents were updated
* Fixed an issue where manual field binding configurations might get overwritten by automatic binding logic
* Field level verification in Binder is no longer run twice

## Vaadin 8.15.0

* Change license from Apache 2.0 to CVDLv4
* Add more intuitive resynchronization error message
* Allow scrolling away from a Grid using touch
* Throw exception when attempting to merge BeanPropertySets with identical keys but different value types
